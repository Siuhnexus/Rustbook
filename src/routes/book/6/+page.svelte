   Understanding Ownership

 <p>
  Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest
of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without
needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership
works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as several related
features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.
